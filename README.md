# training-osdf-climate

## Notes

examples from Emma: https://github.com/NCAR/osdf_examples
* This looks like the simplest to implement: https://github.com/NCAR/osdf_examples/blob/main/notebooks/ndc_workflows/sonar_ai.ipynb
* these would need to be detangled from the PBS stuff:
    * https://github.com/NCAR/osdf_examples/blob/main/notebooks/geocat_climatology.ipynb
    * https://github.com/NCAR/osdf_examples/blob/main/notebooks/cesm_oceanheat.ipynb

Andrew's example: https://github.com/aowen-uwmad/osdf-python-climate

## To Dos
- get a list of potential input files we could use
- Once we decide on inputs, make a mirror somewhere in space we control
- confirm outline with everyone
- make a container?
