## Notes

examples from Emma: https://github.com/NCAR/osdf_examples
* This looks like the simplest to implement: https://github.com/NCAR/osdf_examples/blob/main/notebooks/ndc_workflows/sonar_ai.ipynb
* these would need to be detangled from the PBS stuff:
    * https://github.com/NCAR/osdf_examples/blob/main/notebooks/geocat_climatology.ipynb
    * https://github.com/NCAR/osdf_examples/blob/main/notebooks/cesm_oceanheat.ipynb
